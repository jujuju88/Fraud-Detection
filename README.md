# Online Payments Fraud Detection: Fraud-Detection

## Can a machine learning model accurately predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not?

Used: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, ANN

This is a dataset of bank transactions which have been classified as fraudulent or not.

The work is split into 4 notebooks with main_fraud_detection.ipynb being the first one. The dataset has over 6 million records so it's slowing the loading. At the end of this notebook you will see the next options.

**If you want to run it, you will need to download the dataset from Kaggle (link) below and name it "fraud_detection.csv"**
